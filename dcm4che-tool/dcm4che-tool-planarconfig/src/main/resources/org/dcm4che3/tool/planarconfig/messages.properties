try=Try `planarconfig --help' for more information.
description=\n\
The planarconfig utility detects the actual planar configuration of uncompressed pixel data of color images with \
Photometric Interpretation RGB or YBR_FULL and optionally correct non matching values of attribute Planar Configuration \
of the image. \n\
 \n\
The average chroma (s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) over all pixels and the sum of absolute differences of \
sample values of adjoining pixels is calculated and resulting values on assuming color-by-pixel or color-by-plane planar \
configuration are compared. A lower value for the calculated average chroma and for the sum of absolute differences of \
sample values of adjoining indicates that the assumed planar configuration is correct.\n\
 \n\
If the calculated values of the average chroma and the sum of absolute differences of sample values of adjoining pixels \
indicate contradictory planar configurations, the average difference of sample values between 3x3 tiles assuming \
color-by-pixel is calculated additionally. A value lesser than the specified lower threshold (default: 10) indicates a \
color-by-plane, a value greater than the specified upper threshold (default: 20) a color-by-pixel planar configuration. \n\
 \n\
Otherwise, if the significance of the difference in the average chroma is greater than the significance of the difference \
in the sum of absolute differences of sample values, the detected planar configuration is which resulted in the lesser \
chroma value - otherwise the detected planar configuration is which resulted in lesser differences of sample values of \
adjoining pixels.\n\
 \n\
For each processed file one of the characters: \n\
p - no pixel data \n\
c - compressed pixel data \n\
m - monochrome (or palette color) pixel data \n\
0 - detected color-by-pixel planar configuration, matching with value 0 of attribute Planar Configuration \n\
O - detected color-by-pixel planar configuration, NOT matching with value 1 of attribute Planar Configuration \n\
1 - detected color-by-plane planar configuration, matching with value 1 of attribute Planar Configuration \n\
I - detected color-by-plane planar configuration, NOT matching with value 0 of attribute Planar Configuration \n\
is written to stdout. \n\
If an error occurs on processing a file, an E character is written to stdout and a stack trace is written to stderr. \n-\n\
Options:
example=-
uids=log SOP Instance UIDs of files with not matching value of attribute Planar Configuration in file './uids.log'.
3x3=thresholds for 3x3 pattern detection; 10 20 by default.
fix=fix all files with NOT matching value of attribute Planar Configuration.
fix0=fix value of attribute Planar Configuration with detected color-by-pixel planar configuration to 0.
fix1=fix value of attribute Planar Configuration with detected color-by-plane planar configuration to 1.
v=displays average sample difference between 3x3 tiles, average chroma and sample differences of adjoining pixels in format: \
3x3=<avg-tile-diff>, chroma=[<color-by-pixel>, <color-by-plane>, <significance>], diff=[<color-by-pixel>, <color-by-plane>, <significance>] \
for each processed file.
